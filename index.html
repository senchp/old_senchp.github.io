    <h1>Peter Senchyna</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm a grad student in astronomy at the University of Arizona.
    My research is focused on stellar populations in nearby galaxies.
    I use telescopes like Hubble and the MMT to study stars and gas in a variety of environments, from the large spiral Andromeda to tiny dwarf galaxies with few heavy elements.
    You can find my publications at <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-9132-6561&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc" rel="me">ADS</a>.
