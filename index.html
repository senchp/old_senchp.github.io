    <h1>Peter Senchyna</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm a grad student in astronomy at the University of Arizona.
    My research is focused on stellar populations in nearby galaxies.
    I use telescopes like Hubble to study stars in a variety of environments, from large spirals like Andromeda to tiny dwarf galaxies with few heavy elements.
    You can find my publications at <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Senchyna,%20P&db_key=AST" rel="me">ADS</a>.
